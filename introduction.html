<br><b>Hi there,</b>
<br><br>Let me introduce myself. I am <font color='006699'>Borislav Aymaliev</font>. 
<br>My friends call me <font color='006699'>"Botsik"</font>. I have been called many things - an "economist", "geek" and "opponent" among others.
<br><br>But most importantly, I am <font color='006699'>an experimenter</font>. Consider yourself warned! I do things differently. Sometimes it works, sometimes it backfires, but when I strike gold...
</p>
<p>
<br>I am also a believer. I <font color='006699'>believe in sustainability</font>. I believe that we have sufficient resources to end poverty and sufficient knowledge to fight back our own ignorance. Ultimately, I <font color='006699'>would like to see more happiness in the world</font>. 
<br>That really makes me question the current approach to happiness and some of the underlying economic assumptions. Moreover, <font color='006699'>"efficiency" is a very fascinating topic</font>. Presented with the opportunities, which became available to us after the communications revolution, we have just started to utilize their potential. All the knowledge, all the art... what had once been reserved for the welthy, is now available for the enthusiastic. 
<br>So, what do you reckon we make of it?
</p>
<p>
<br><font color='006699'><b>To do:</b></font>
<br>1. Contribute something new to the knowledge pool of the world. (Achievement)
<br>2. Take a photo with Mount Cook, the highest place in New Zealand. (Traveling)
<br>3. Make people happy through everything I do. (Purpose)
<br>4. Have a study, which is, in a way, close to the unreachable (e.g. a private observatory on the last floor of a house in a quiet Bulgarian village).
